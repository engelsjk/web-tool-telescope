<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Telescope was a web-tool used to access and analyze data related to the development of a wind farm, specifically aspects of power performance testing of wind turbines related to the international standard IEC 61400-12-1. It allowed the user to review the geographical layout of a wind farm and provided interactive features for selecting optimal locations of test turbines and meteorelogical towers using complex geospatial analysis.

<p>
Telescope was an internal web-tool I developed in the wind industry a couple of years ago and is probably still the most complex technical web development project I've worked on to date. It was the culmination of my earliest experimentation with web development, and the most complex in a series of web tools I developed to support techanical support and sales at an international wind turbine manufacturing company.

<p>
I'm still incredibly proud of this project and it represents some of my most valued professional strengths: identifying issues with efficiency and knowledge sharing, reverse-engineering systems and figuring out how to use new tools, ...

This write-up covers the five main components of Telescope: Project, Turbines, Met, PPT and Terrain. In the following sections, I'll provide a brief write-up of each component, both in terms of functionality and development. No source code is included.
